    description: Worked with NASA DEVELOP on a team of three other researchers looking at land disturbance from coal mining in Wyoming's Powder River Basin using  Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM), Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+), and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI). We used LandTrendr analysis using Tasseled Cap Angle to track land disturbance and recovery. Check out more of our project documentation [here]. We will have a software tool available in a few months that allows users to upload polygons, create geometries, or select known coal mine locations and produce outputs like video and images, pixel change over time, and compare coal mine disturbance with sensitive habitat areas in Google Earth Engine.

    description: Used Google Places API to match locations of cannabis dispensaries in San Francisco, CA with the permits for sale of cannabis from the California Department of Food and Agriculture. This was part of a reproducible and collaborative data science class, happy to share code but you will need your own API key to reproduce my analysis and maps.
