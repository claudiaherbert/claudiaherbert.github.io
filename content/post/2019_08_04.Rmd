# Intro to GIS labs

### 1. Digitizing and Digital Elevation Models

This lab was developed using Google Earth Pro (free!) and Arc Map. I am looking forward to adapting this to include Arc Pro and R functions. 


### 2. Raster Math functions and Sea Level Rise

This lab looks at different senarios of Sea Level Rise impact land cover in the San Francisco Bay.
