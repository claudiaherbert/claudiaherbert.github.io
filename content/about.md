I am a PhD student at UC Berkeley in Environmental Science, Policy and Management studying fire ecology using remote sensing. I am co-advised by Dr. Van Butsic, who studies Land Use Change, and Dr. Scott Stephens, who works on wildland fire. I am interested in Improved Forest Management carbon offsets in California's cap-and-trade market and questions of environmental justice in wildfire recovery. 

I have a Bachelor's of Science from UC Berkeley, where I majored in Conservation and Resource Studies and Society and Environment and minored in Forestry, Public Policy, and Geospatial Information Systems.
