I am a PhD student at UC Berkeley in Environmental Science, Policy and Management studying fire ecology using remote sensing. I am co-advised by Dr. Van Butsic, who studies [land use and land use change](https://luclab.berkeley.edu/), and Dr. Scott Stephens, who researches [wildland fire](https://nature.berkeley.edu/stephenslab/). I am interested in Improved Forest Management carbon offsets in California's cap-and-trade market and questions of environmental justice in wildfire recovery. 

I have a Bachelor of Science from UC Berkeley, where I majored in Conservation and Resource Studies and Society and Environment and minored in Forestry, Public Policy, and Geospatial Information Systems.
