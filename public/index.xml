Feel free to use these intro labs or share any thoughts you have about them with me.

      <description>I am a PhD student at UC Berkeley in Environmental Science, Policy and Management studying fire ecology using remote sensing. I am co-advised by Dr. Van Butsic, who studies land use and land use change, and Dr. Scott Stephens, who researches wildland fire. I am interested in Improved Forest Management carbon offsets in California&amp;rsquo;s cap-and-trade market and questions of environmental justice in wildfire recovery.
I have a Bachelor of Science from UC Berkeley, where I majored in Conservation and Resource Studies and Society and Environment and minored in Forestry, Public Policy, and Geospatial Information Systems.</description>
