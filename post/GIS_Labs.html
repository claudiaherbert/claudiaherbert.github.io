<h1>Sharing GIS labs</h1>
<p>I was a Graduate Student Instructor for Berkeley’s ESPM 72 in Spring 2019, Intro to Geographic Information Sciences. I enjoyed sharing my excitement for GIS with students and want to share some of the teaching materials I developed for the lab section of this course. Feel free to use these intro labs or share any thoughts you have about them with me.</p>

<h3>1. Digitizing and Digital Elevation Models</h3>
<p>This lab was developed using Google Earth Pro (free!) and Arc Map to demonstrate how to digitize satellite imagery (in this case, we’re looking at before and after the construction of the Three Gorges Dam in China) and introducing some basic data editing tools in Arc Map. This lab also uses Digital Elevation Model to estimate volumn of water.</p>
<p>I am looking forward to adapting this to for Arc Pro.</p>

<h3>2. Raster Math functions and Sea Level Rise</h3>
<p>This lab looks compares two senarios of Sea Level Rise in the San Francisco Bay using raster math and uses the National Land Cover Dataset (NLCD) to determine what types of land cover will be flooded as a result of SLR.</p>
